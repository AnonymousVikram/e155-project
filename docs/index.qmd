For our final MicroPs project, we combined an FPGA and a microcontroller (MCU) to create an edge detection filter, capable of processing images and outputting the results to a VGA monitor. We chose to process our image data by separating the image capture and image processing to the MCU and FPGA respectively. The MCU handles the image preparation processes like greyscaling to get it ready for edge detection. It then sends the input image data to the FPGA through SPI and allows users to see the edge-detection. The FPGA handles the computationally intensive task of edge detection following a Sobel algorithm. The parallel processing capabilities of the FPGA ensure efficient computation. The processed image data, now highlighting edges, is outputted on the monitor via VGA. Our block diagram for our system is reproduced below:
